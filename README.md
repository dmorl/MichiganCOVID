## Spreadsheet Overviews

### MichiganOverview_Cases.csv

**Source:** Data is found under the Cumulative Data link of Michigan's Coronavirus webpage, https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/stats (active),  https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163-520743--,00.html (obsolete) and https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173---,00.html (obsolete) <br />
**Description:** A spreadsheet converting tabular data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Michigan released by the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services. Confirmed cases only include individuals who have had a positive diagnostic laboratory test for COVID-19 <br />
**Date range:** 2020-03-10 through 2022-08-23 <br />
**Missing dates:** 2020-03-20, 2020-08-21, 2020-09-06, 2020-11-26, 2020-12-24, 2020-12-25, 2020-12-31, 2021-01-01, 2021-05-31, 2021-09-06, 2021-11-26 <br />

**Author notes:** This spreadsheet combines multiple tables with counts and demographics about confirmed COVID-19 cases in Michigan for ease of use. Variables are parsed into sections providing additional information about each table <br />
As of 2020-06-05, Michigan.gov has moved over to the Microsoft Power BI data dashboard to display statistics. As a result, archiving the webpage is no longer effective. Some table names have changed, so SECTIONS now include a TableDescription that describes variable location pre-dashboard, and DashDescription, that describes variable location post-dashboard relocation. As a result of the move, some variables are no longer reported while others have been added. Notably, many variables are now being reported as raw numbers instead of percentages <br />
As of 2022-04-22, the website url was updated to https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/stats <br />

### MichiganOverview_ProbableCases.csv

**Description:** A spreadsheet converting dashboard data of COVID-19 probable cases in Michigan released by the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services. Probable cases include individuals who have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case or a positive serology (antibody) test, but do not have a positive diagnostic laboratory test for COVID-19 and individuals with a positive serology (antibody) test for COVID-19 and an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case. The number of probable cases can change daily based on information obtained through the health department investigation. Probable cases can be re-classified as a confirmed case or determined to not be a case <br />
**Date range:** 2020-03-01 through 2022-08-23 <br />
**Missing dates:** 2020-03-20, 2020-08-21, 2020-09-06, 2020-11-26, 2020-12-24, 2020-12-25, 2020-12-31, 2021-01-01, 2021-05-31, 2021-09-06, 2021-11-26 <br />

**Author notes:** As of 2020-06-05, Michigan.gov has moved over to the Microsoft Power BI data dashboard and began reporting probable COVID cases. However, the Author did not begin collecting demographic information on probable cases until 2020-06-07 <br />
Probable cases can increase as more unconfirmed COVID-19 cases are identified, and decrease as these probable cases are confirmed and added to the official COVID-19 case count, or disconfirmed as cases and removed from the spreadsheet <br />
As of 2022-04-22, the website url was updated to https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/stats <br />

On 2020-06-13, MDHHS released the downloadable file "Confirmed and Probable Cases by County by Date" (subsequently "Cases by County by Date") ranging from March 2020 onwards. Therefore, numbers between 2020-03-01 and 2020-06-04 are taken from a different source than the dashboard and may result in some discrepancies <br />
