Note on Case Fatality Rate: As of 4/16/2020, the MDHHS is including a case fatality rate for jurisdictions with at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 infection. The case fatality rate is the proportion of people who have died from causes associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection. It is often used as one of the measures of the severity of illness.  However, it is important to note several factors can affect this measurement. The methodology employed to identify confirmed cases of illness can impact on the case fatality rate if the cases identified are more likely to be among people with serious illness. A testing strategy that has historically included prioritizing limited testing resources toward confirming infection of hospitalized cases of disease can lead to the overestimation of serious consequences greater than experienced by the entire population of ill persons.  The impact of a low number of cases in any specific jurisdiction can contribute to a less accurate and a falsely high proportion of deaths. The results also hinge on public health's ability to identify and include all associated deaths.",57%,43%,<1%,0%,<1%,1%,4%,10%,19%,27%,37%,0%,20,107,73.6,75,<1%,1%,41%,41%,2%,2%,13%,1%,69%,30%,,,

As a part of this process, records that identify COVID-19 infection as a contributing factor to death are compared against all laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). If a death certificate is matched to a confirmed COVID-19 case and that record in the MDSS does not indicate the individual died, the MDSS record is updated to indicate the death and the appropriate local health department is notified. These matched deaths are then included with mortality information posted to the Michigan Coronavirus website. As a result of the most recent assessment, today’s data includes 20 additional deaths identified by this methodology.

*Note on new daily cases (08/21/20): Today’s number of new cases is less than expected due to a recent issue with the reporting of electronic lab results. A large number of received lab messages were improperly formatted and temporarily blocked some valid results from being processed and entered into the reporting system. This issue is currently being fixed. As the valid results enter the system over the next day or two, there will likely be higher than expected numbers of daily case counts. This lab result backlog should not affect the 7-day rolling average or the cases by date of onset in the dashboard data.

This slowdown started Tuesday and delayed the entry of some lab results by up to 15 hours. The issue was resolved yesterday and the processing of lab results is now operating normally. No data was lost. Today's count of cases includes a number of cases that would have been included in yesterday's total. 
**Note on deaths (10/15/20): Regular reviews of death certificate data maintained in Vital Records reporting systems are conducted by MDHHS staff three times per week. As a part of this process, records that identify COVID-19 infection as a contributing factor to death are compared against all laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). If a death certificate is matched to a confirmed COVID-19 case and that record in the MDSS does not indicate the individual died, the MDSS record is updated to indicate the death and the appropriate local health department is notified. These matched deaths are then included with mortality information posted to the Michigan Coronavirus website. As a result of the most recent assessment, today’s data includes 21 additional deaths identified by this methodology.

As a part of this process, records that identify COVID-19 infection as a contributing factor to death are compared against all laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). If a death certificate is matched to a confirmed COVID-19 case and that record in the MDSS does not indicate the individual died, the MDSS record is updated to indicate the death and the appropriate local health department is notified.

As a part of this process, records that identify COVID-19 infection as a contributing factor to death are compared against all laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS). If a death certificate is matched to a confirmed COVID-19 case and that record in the MDSS does not indicate the individual died, the MDSS record is updated to indicate the death and the appropriate local health department is notified. These matched deaths are then included with mortality information posted to the Michigan Coronavirus website. As a result of the most recent assessment, today’s data includes 132 additional deaths identified by this methodology.
