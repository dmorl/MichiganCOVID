Note on Case Fatality Rate: As of 4/16/2020, the MDHHS is including a case fatality rate for jurisdictions with at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 infection. The case fatality rate is the proportion of people who have died from causes associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection. It is often used as one of the measures of the severity of illness.  However, it is important to note several factors can affect this measurement. The methodology employed to identify confirmed cases of illness can impact on the case fatality rate if the cases identified are more likely to be among people with serious illness. A testing strategy that has historically included prioritizing limited testing resources toward confirming infection of hospitalized cases of disease can lead to the overestimation of serious consequences greater than experienced by the entire population of ill persons.  The impact of a low number of cases in any specific jurisdiction can contribute to a less accurate and a falsely high proportion of deaths. The results also hinge on public health's ability to identify and include all associated deaths.",57%,43%,<1%,0%,<1%,1%,4%,10%,19%,27%,37%,0%,20,107,73.6,75,<1%,1%,41%,41%,2%,2%,13%,1%,69%,30%,,,
